### About the Project
In this project we created an AI Model to predict the stock prices of any company.

This was the data we fed to the AI Model

#### Machine Learning Model: XGBoost

It is a bunch of decision trees running parallely. The number of decision can be controlled. In this model we used 4.

### Outcome/Observations:

1. Since the AI model follows the actual trend, we can assume the data fed heavily impacts its accuracy.

2. The amount of data fed is directly proportional to the accuracy of the model.

3. The tree depth is directly proportional to the accuracy of the model up to a certain point.

4. The number of iterations is directly proportional to the accuracy of the model up to a certain point.

5. The AI model can't predict events outside of the data given. However when more data is fed, it tends to follow the trend.
